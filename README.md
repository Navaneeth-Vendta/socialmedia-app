# Social Media App

The social media app created using React is a dynamic and interactive platform where people can share their thoughts. Built with the popular JavaScript library React, the app offers a seamless and intuitive user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

The React app offers users the option to switch between two visually distinct modes: Dark Mode and Light Mode. This feature allows users to personalize their viewing experience based on their preferences and lighting conditions.

The app's styling is accomplished using Sass, a CSS preprocessor, which aids in streamlining and enhancing the CSS code by providing advanced features and a more efficient development workflow.
